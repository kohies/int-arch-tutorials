# Welcome to Int-Arch-Code

In this series of lessons, you will be presented with architectural problems in a given codebase.
The application, which you will be improving a little bit each lesson, is called *High Performance* and computes bonus salaries for vacuum cleaner salesmen.

Start a lesson by hovering over it in the tutorial section in the bottom of the Explorer-Panel and clicking the little play button next to it.

You are working inside a Docker container, which is a virtual linux machine, with all the tools and dependencies that you need for these tutorials.

If you want to pause your work, you can disconnect from the container by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and then type "Close Remote Connection" and press Enter.

If you want to resume your work, open the Remote Explorer in the sidebar and click on the little folder icon of the container.
