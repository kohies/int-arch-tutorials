You are working inside a Docker container, which is a virtual linux machine, with all the tools and dependencies that you need for these tutorials.

If you want to pause your work, you can disconnect from the container by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P and then type "Close Remote Connection" and press Enter.

If you want to resume your work, open the Remote Explorer in the sidebar and click on the little folder icon of the container.
