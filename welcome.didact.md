# Welcome to Int-Arch-Code

You can start a Tutorial by hovering over it in the bottom of the Explorer and clicking the little play button next to it.

You are working inside a Docker container, which is a virtual linux machine, with all the tools and dependencies that you need for these tutorials.

If you want to disconnect from the container press Ctrl+Shift+P and then type "Close Remote Connection" and press Enter.

If you want to resume your work, open the Remote Explorer in the sidebar and click on the little folder icon of the container.
